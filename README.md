# shiny-uart-32bits
serial UART communication to send and transmit 32 bits via RS232 in vhdl with FPGA Cyclone IV
 This repository uses a RS232 DB9 Cable, to send 32 bits via uart from FPGA to serial terminal in PC

Inside the project, you can see BITMAP from simulation, each part from FSM is divided in 8 bits, that is, bits are sent in blocks.
